## Shared conventions

<!-- These are Nico's cross-repo output rules. They're materialized into each repo's
CLAUDE.md so every agent (local, cloud, third-party) sees them as plain text. Source
of truth: prompt-lab/workflow/claude-md-shared.md — edit there and re-sync, never here. -->

- **Clickable URLs.** When pointing at any web destination (dashboard, repo, PR, deploy, settings, docs, localhost), print the full bare URL — `https://example.com` or `http://localhost:8080` — on its own, never just the page's name and never a markdown `[label](url)` link. Nico's terminal auto-linkifies raw `https://` text, so a bare URL is one-click and stays copyable.

- **Number your questions.** Any time you ask Nico more than one question, present them as a numbered list (1., 2., 3.) so he can answer by number with no ambiguity. A single standalone question needs no number.

- **Self-contained smoke-test instructions.** When you ask Nico to manually test or verify an app or website, assume zero carried-over context — he should never scroll back or recall a URL/path/credential from earlier. Always include: the exact URL (full `https://…` or `http://localhost:…`, restated even if mentioned above), the precise steps in order, and what a pass vs. fail looks like. Repetition here is a feature, not clutter.

- **No marker before a copy-paste command block.** Nico's terminal renders markdown bullets (`-`, `*`, `•`) as `●`, which breaks paste into zsh. The line directly above a fenced command block must be a plain-text label ending in a colon — never a bullet, dash, asterisk, or number. For loud copy targets, lead the label with `📋` + bold `COPY THE BELOW`, then a colon, then the block.

## Cross-repo handoff with prompt-lab

This repo coordinates with **prompt-lab** (producer of the public history tables this site consumes via `/api/public_history`) through an append-only log in the private repo `nicolovejoy/handoff`, cloned to `~/src/.handoff`. The matching file is `selected-projects-prompt-lab.md`. prompt-lab's SessionStart hook auto-injects its `## Active` section; here, read it manually at session start. To reply, append an entry to the top of `## Active` (`### YYYY-MM-DD selected-projects → prompt-lab: <subject>`) and `cd ~/src/.handoff && git pull --rebase && git commit -am … && git push` (or use prompt-lab's `~/.claude/bin/handoff.sh append`/`sync` if installed). Move acted-on entries to `## Archived` with a one-line outcome.
